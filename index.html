        BTS, as you might have heard before, is a South Korean Boyband who debutted in 2013. The acronym BTS in general is short for Bangtan Boys or Bangtan Sonyeondan which rouhgly translates to Bulletproof Boy Scouts in English. The band consists of seven members, Kim Namjoon, Kim Seokjin, Min Yoongi, Jung Hoseok, Park Jimin, Kim Taehyung, and Jeon Jungkook. In case you haven't realized, the names are in order of which they are sung in the fanchant. *wink* These are the seven members birth names and you will be able to find out more about them when you click on their names mentioned in this paragraph or on the navagation bar. Below are some of the more general and lightly detailed, perhaps more, information about BTS. Note information about a single member of the band can be found when you click their name in the navigation bar.

      <p>
        BTS made their debut on June 12, 2013 with thier debut album '2 Kool 4 Skool'. The album was part of their "school trilogy" series. The lead single was "No More Dream," which quickly fell of charts. Mind you, in 2013, their company, Big Hit Entertainment, was not big or popular as it is today. In fact it was a small but established company founded in 2005. Unlike the Big Three entertainment companies of South Korea who's artists were famous and exposed even before their debut, BTS had a hard time during thier debut.It's hard to tell how many fans they started off with but their debut was rough and they had about a few hundred people as fans, unlike other debut groups under the Big Three.

        As mentioned above, BTS cosists of seven members. There are three rappers and four vocalists. The rappers or the rap line include Min Yoongi aka Suga, Kim Namjoon aka RM and Jung Hoseok aka J-Hope. The vocalists are the remaining four members of the group, Jeon Jungkook aka JK, Kim Taehyung aka V, Kim Seokjin aka Jin and Park Jimin aka Jimin. Kim Namjoon also known as RM was the first to join BTS, and part of the original line up. Our President of the Glorious Big Hit Entertainment, Bang Si-Hyuk originally intented to create a hip hop group (as seen by the first few songs they released) before it was became an idol group similar to Seo Taiji and the Boys. The members did recieve public criticism for this and have been told things like they weren't idol enough. Suga was the second to join BTS followed by J-Hope, Jin, V and then Jimin. However, for their debut line-up V was the last member to be revealed as part of BTS. V was held as a secret weapon by Bang Si-Hyuk, as he knew he was precious and talented enough to atract attention and hype up the group.

      <legend id="albums">BTS Albums</legend>
      <p>
        Starting since their debut in 2013 up till now (Feb, 2022) BTS has released 21 albums as of 2021. (Updates shall be availbel soon, sorry.) The 21 albums do inclue ones re-recorded in Japanese and smaller releases like the BTS World Sountrack. With a fanbase as big as the ARMYs, nothing released by BTS is small. You don't mess with them.

        According to a fan, as of June 2019, BTS had 6 studie albums, 5 complimations albums, 6 extended plays and 3 single albums.

        A thing to take note of; BTS is a group however some of its members do work with other artists to release solo albums, mixtapes and singles. More information about the specifics can be found the specific members page.
